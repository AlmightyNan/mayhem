In the organised income sector there are different ways of recognising Financial Identity of a person through his salaried employment, ITR and other financial instruments to validate his creditworthiness. But this is not true for the unorganized income sector, say for a maid, electrician, Plumber etc. where they do not have an instrument to show their financial identity and thus the creditworthiness. Because of this they are deprived of many of the schemes of financial assistance from government.
